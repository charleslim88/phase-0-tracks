# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* Version control keeps track of all of your changes to a project. It is useful because it allows you to go back to your git commit messages to see what you did.
* A branch is a copy of the master that allows you to make changes without going into the master. It is useful because you are making changes to the project without messing up the master.
* A commit happens everytime you make changes to a local file to send it to an online repository. A good commit message is something that is to the point and concise of what you did. 
* A merge conflict happens when someone is working on their local repository and when they try to commit something, it doesn't go through because someone on the online repository made changes therefore it wont sync.
